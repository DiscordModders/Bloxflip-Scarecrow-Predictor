# Scarecrow Bloxflip Predictor
**You can message me at**: Methionylalanylthreonyl#9557

A program that uses strategies and probability maths to choose the best times to bet on BloxFlip's crash gamemode. https://bloxflip.com/crash. <br>
THIS DOES NOT PREDICT 100% WHEN ITS GOING TO CRASH. Instead either it uses a betting strategy or compares the previous crash games to see if it'd be a good idea to bet or to find a good multiplier  <br>

# Configuration and set up
To edit the configuration simply go into the config.json file. 
- The multiplier is the point at which the program will auto bet at 
- Only if you have the key you can put on config.json if you not have put nothing!
- The bet amount is the amount of robux to bet each time
- Auto stop is the amount of Robux at which the program will stop betting.
- Your authorization is the token used on bloxflip to place bets. To get your own auth go onto bloxflip press inspect element and go into the console. Then paste the following code
```
localStorage.getItem('_DO_NOT_SHARE_BLOXFLIP_TOKEN')
```
 This will print your auth token to the console. Copy it without the quotes then put it into the config.json file

# Usage
To run the program make sure you have python installed and also pip. If you don't install python here https://www.python.org/downloads/. <br>
Pip should be preinstalled but if it isn't go to  https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/ <br>
Once you have done these two things either run installer.bat or open cmd CD to the directory and type the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
